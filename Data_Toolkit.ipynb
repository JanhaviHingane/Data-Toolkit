        "Q: What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: NumPy is a Python library for numerical and scientific computing. It is widely used because it provides fast multidimensional arrays and supports vectorized mathematical operations, making computation much faster than Python lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding the smaller array to match the larger one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: A DataFrame is a 2D labeled data structure in Pandas that stores data in rows and columns like an Excel or SQL table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "A: groupby() groups data based on certain conditions and then applies aggregation functions such as sum, mean, count, etc., on each group.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Seaborn provides visually appealing plots with fewer lines of code and has built-in support for statistical visualizations such as heatmaps, distribution plots, and regression plots.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: NumPy arrays are faster, more memory-efficient, fixed in data type, and support vectorized operations; Python lists are slower, allow mixed data types, and do not support vectorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: A heatmap uses colors to represent values in a matrix. It should be used to show relationships or correlations between variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What does the term “vectorized operation” mean in NumPy?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: It means performing arithmetic on entire arrays at once without using loops, which significantly speeds up computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Matplotlib generates static (non-interactive) plots, while Plotly generates interactive plots suitable for dashboards and web visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the significance of hierarchical indexing in Pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: It enables multiple index levels for rows or columns, making it easier to work with grouped or multidimensional data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the role of Seaborn’s pairplot() function?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: pairplot() visualizes pairwise relationships between numerical variables using scatterplots and histograms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the purpose of the describe() function in Pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: describe() provides statistical summary information such as count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for numerical columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Missing data can lead to incorrect calculations or biased results, so it must be filled or removed for accurate analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What are the benefits of using Plotly for data visualization?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Plotly creates interactive visualizations, supports 3D charts, dashboards, and integrates easily with web applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: NumPy uses ndarray, which supports N-dimensional data storage with efficient indexing and operations along each axis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the role of Bokeh in data visualization?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Bokeh is used to create interactive, web-based visualizations and dashboards with JavaScript integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Explain the difference between apply() and map() in Pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "A: map() works on Series and transforms each value; apply() works on both Series and DataFrames and applies functions row-wise or column-wise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What are some advanced features of NumPy?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Linear algebra operations, random number generation, Fourier transforms, broadcasting, and memory-efficient multidimensional storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: How does Pandas simplify time series analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Pandas supports date indexing, resampling, shifting, rolling statistics, and frequency conversion, making time-based analysis easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the role of a pivot table in Pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Pivot tables summarize data by grouping and aggregating values—similar to Excel’s pivot table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Why is NumPy’s array slicing faster than Python’s list slicing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: NumPy slicing returns a view of the same memory without copying data, while list slicing creates a new list and copies elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What are some common use cases for Seaborn?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Visualizing distributions, correlations, pairwise plots, regression plots, heatmaps, and categorical comparisons."
